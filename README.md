# Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) Detection Project
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder among
women of reproductive age. It is characterised by hormonal imbalances, irregular
menstrual cycles, and the presence of cysts in the ovaries. Early detection and
diagnosis of PCOS are crucial for effective management and prevention of
complications.

The prevalence rate of PCOS is high among Indian women. The pooled prevalence
of PCOS was close to 10% using Rotterdam's criteria and AES criteria, while it was
5.8% using NIH criteria. The study's overall finding emphasises the need for more
acceptable and uniform diagnostic criteria for screening PCOS.

Our aim is to provide easy and reliable diagnosis for PCOS so that every woman
has a reach and is able to take appropriate measures for it. For this, we are taking
help from Machine Learning. We have taken a big dataset that contains info of
many women around earth and has many medical parameters like follicle length,
height,weight etc. Our model takes some medical parameters of a patient as
inputs and then guesses the probability that the woman is suffering from PCOS or
not. The whole frontend of our web application is deployed using Python Flask and
bootstrap and the backend is written in Python language using appropriate ML
models.
